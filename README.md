## Course Overview

CS231n provides an in-depth understanding of the principles and techniques behind convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their applications in visual recognition tasks. The course includes lectures, assignments, and projects that help reinforce the concepts learned.

## Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to all assignments in the CS231n course. Each assignment is organized in its own directory and includes:

- **Code**: The implementation of the assignment in Python.

### Completed Assignments

1. **Assignment 1**: Image Classification, kNN, SVM, Softmax, Fully-Connected Neural Network
2. **Assignment 2**: Fully-Connected Nets, Batch Normalization, Dropout, Convolutional Nets, Network Visualization
3. **Assignment 3**: Image Captioning with Vanilla RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers, Generative Adversarial Networks
5. **Final Project**: Ongoing

## Notes

I have prepared a few PDF notes summarizing key concepts and techniques covered in the course. These notes are intended for personal reference and may be useful for anyone looking to reinforce their understanding of the material.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the assignments)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Matplotlib
